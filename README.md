# Static_randomfood
A static random food generator using api

Hey, this is my static app using food api.

I kinda like this repo because it gives me some idea on how people interact with servers.

Well, im off to a good start for learning fullstack development.

I was  kinda going for dragonballz api but it was down and i cant connect to it.

Ahhhh. the feeling of connecting each of the dots in my curiosity.

Connecting or Connection is a must to learn IOT because every thing just hopes on how things related to each other.

I meant its hard learning things without the feeling of connecting these dots.

And im hungry for more.
